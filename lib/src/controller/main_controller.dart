      "content":"Only whisper was all I heard before I melted, melted with just a glimpse of the window, I barely had just opened my eyes, seeing such a majestic glimpse, where distance felt like depth, I got up suddenly, realizing where he was at that moment. From the back room he shouted, “worried!!? If I missed it?” , “missed what?!” I asked him, “The two most beautiful thing” he said. I asked him what were those two things, he pulled me by waist , we were so close that I couldn’t even think straight, he wrapped me so tight and rested his head on me and whispered “don’t worry , I didn’t missed”. Just seeing his face I felt convinced all of a sudden , I just moved by lips to the happy side , but he carried his voice to laughing seeing my eyes , he knew I didn’t felt convinced. I got the forehead kiss as usual and he sent me to freshen up. The air , water , everything felt so different . I saw my wet face in mirror, realizing he had the same eyes as mine last night . I felt as if I am seeing at him for a moment, I just barely had an essence of last night . I felt so drawn to the moment which barely I could remember, I felt really lost at that moment. I heard him, felt his hand and I was drawn to the bed. He wiped my face as I stayed pale. I felt his warmth on both my shoulder. Only a blue glare, a clear wipe of wind was all I could think of, I just felt so lost in present. I saw his cheerful eyes, “what happened” he asked softly with a very resolved lips, as if he knows what I am through. I heard “wait” and he left. It was for a moment I started to think about us arriving here , I was at peace . I couldn’t resist the smell of my treasured meal , I took the first sink , I felt not quiet at ease , all because he feed me, It felt so unusual . I could see his eyes , so resolved and so much into me, his eyes felt it just wants me. “don’t worry” was all he said when he left gently touching my face. I sat quietly, thinking what really happened last night. This profound change, I felt , made me captivated. I couldn’t shed light on its start nor could I see it dying. He lifted me wrap me with a blanket. I just could feel his arms reached me around. I could clearly get the reach of that breath I took. I felt his warm lips on my cheek, the sound felt melodic, like a single drop in a calm lake would feel. The echo in me was never ending, his face was so close, all I could do was bear that pleasure. “Ecstasy” he said resting his palm, my cheeks felt warm, I started to melt, my insight felt as if it wanted to get out, get out of anything I am not. I could see his face at ease, “You never could leave behind yourself, could you” he said. There was no way that he wouldn’t understand that I was just being a mirror to myself. The glare of his eyes with his word, made me realized that I was being the biggest truth to myself at that at that moment in the entire life I live. I never could be myself much. Courage, to look forward to myself was a grave path I have always felt. I felt worse at knee unable to hold myself anymore, I never continue that path to myself, abandoned it and never faced it again. But at that moment, I just drowned deep inside me, felt my world was a ruin. But I was wrong, he held me when I couldn’t hold myself, a warm hand was all I needed in that path, happiness was felt that its just a moment away in the path. Changed, everything about that word, Happiness, changed for me, Birth of new perception was all I felt. Happiness cant be found in any place that exist, but only can be felt, even in the depth of misery. I became such. That path in me felt so strange, never felt I existed here, I felt its time I wanted to go back, back where I now belong, to those arms that have longed for me. “I can live without that warmth in me”, “I am alright” was all I could mange to say at that moment. I wrapped around him, I touched his face, I couldn’t help longing for those eyes and for a moment I stood on knee. I wanted to feel his lips desperately, I want to feel that moist, want to touch his insight, I felt I couldn’t contain myself, I could totally feel blood gushing all my way out, my face felt pale as it brightened, It was delightful, the moment I barely see his eyes half closed. But, he held me by face, “Things can wait”,”You forgot right!? The last Night” he said. I barely could remember just anything, but a single moment, I chose to go with his intent, I never could force thing out on him, but for one I did. As I see him carrying his beloved, he gave me one, and took one for himself and got under the blanket, made his eyes implied me to read, as he starts, it feels so different to see him in his own little world, It was all but words but meant a world to him. I stared at him just a glance, he was already captivated, and I was at ease seeing him onto it, as if every single moment meant something to him. Seeing him in it, felt something so ordinary yet full of compassion, made me feel my heart out a little. I didn’t felt lost, but I did smile. I always felt that about him, a little glimpse of happiness that defies anything that I can think of. I turned to myself  pulling the blanket onto my chest, I got more comfortable until the time I had to face the depth of words, I am not fond of words, they don’t talk to me as it does to him, every time I am faced with words, I touch his insight, I couldn’t think of anything but him. It futile, I utterly feel that he shared his world to me, the world that I was never aware of, the garden of words, where he dwells, so peacefully, where sadness has yet to reach miles, he took me there with me, but my eyes couldn’t perceive the heaven of words, many life I could see him live, many places I can see him dwell, all for the grace of eyes that can have him dissolve in it, but I got the eyes to such insight, totally unaware of the whereabouts, that cling to him and his soul, so warm and light, that implies nothing but goodness, straight form heart. Pleasant sound is rarely a thing that I ever notice, yet I couldn’t even resist that wipe for outside window, I felt as the world was moving, cold wind was what I loved about it, just by observing it feels as it passes through me , such soothing sensation, I was completely drawn to it. Just seeing the view from outside window, I felt like soothing my eyes with it, I put my blanket off and he held me, “Forgot about last night!, about that time?” he said, there’s something about his eyes, I never could deny, as my heart feels to follow him, always I hear him, I feel a deep motive, so deep that I am drawn to him, I was glad I could stay by his side, I just smiled and put my blanket on and I just told him to continue his dreaming, he giggled , I felt so glad that moment, I loved his giggle. It makes me see him as a kid, until he ended it with such grasping smile, It contrast him being such responsible, I smiled and turned. It was for him as I could put myself onto someone; I always feel he oversees me. For a moment I start to feel like knowing where will he really be now, in the depth or the heights, but I chose not to go for it. I jyst held the book I had and tried to lay , I was quiet turned by cherishing the silky surface if the white blanket, I felt as if my hearts been touched by a warm delight, I started to feel tingle and warm, I chose to rest my eyes, I felt a different peace there. It was my insight that I never dared to even look. I was open to such I have never felt before. I have been closed for so long, but never a moment I felt like chasing the reason of that profound change in me, my feeling was beyond any reason, I felt not any words could describe, even to him. I was totally beyond any essence of reality, yet it feels so real. I chose to embrace get embrace by this so dark, but delight. I felt beauty with warmth , I couldn’t touch it but it had a grasped me, made me unaware of my own existence, yet I never could feel more alive, I forgot my breath, my soul felt floating, circles of melody, I couldn’t listen but feel, such shine of light I feel but I couldn’t see, I was all illuminated, I couldn’t contain myself to it, I was glad , I gave away myself to the silence. I was all I could depict until I see the wave of his silhouette, it was him staring at me, he touched my face, “So, where did you?” he said, I laughed, he saw me happy with the glare of questions. “It was beautiful” I exclaimed, seeing his face, I was so sure he felt as my eyes said the words. He pulled me up and said “It’s been long, you were so at trance, I didn’t feel like waking you up” , I wrapped him by his chest and I felt warm laying my head on him. He rubbed my back out of sudden and I started to realize that I was feeling more of him, his touch, wishing him to keep doing it, my lips couldn’t help going for him, I stared at him, I smiled, held his heads back and start to feels his moist, his lips expressed his inner peace with me, we both were breathing as one. As I was getting so deep into it, the moment I felt he pulled away himself and saw me thoroughly with his loving eyes ,”I got so carried” he laughed, I was so annoyed, I asked him about it, I was oddly desperate. He said “Last Night, you had me a promise” and grabbed my face with both of his palm “I suppose you forgot” he added. I was so drawn back to the last night as if I could feel that essence in air, the blue dark amber was all I could see, rustling of trees felt as if just by those melodies I felt I own all these. I had been one with them. “I don’t want to let go of this moment, Isn’t it?” I asked and he asked about what he replied yesterday, I tried to remember it , but couldn’t get it, he smiled and said “I promise you to relive this moment again and we won’t look a single glance of outside till that moment”, I smiled at him and looked outside the window, I felt like wishing to have a look but I chose not to. Good time was approaching, I felt seeing the dark outside. I exclaimed about the supper, we had it real nice, he feed me again. Its quiet the warmth I felt. I must say , my heart was filled, he loved doing it. An utmost care, I tried to feed him, he laughed but had it at last. The sun was in, the hazy amber light was on, I wished it twinkled, but I looked around, everything changed. Seeing the wooden glare everywhere, like the air carried the amber around everywhere. I just rushed to the window, opened it and felt frozen, I could feel lost to the wind. Breathtaking was all I could say, the mountains were so far outreach, yet I feel I could touch it, I could hear forest’s moving and the clouds were all in pain, hiding the truth of undying beauty, I wanted to see it, but it was not the time. I got his arms around my neck, he held so gently yet so tight. I felt tingling sensation until he rests his chin over my head, I reached his palm, such warm it was, “I didn’t knew such thing exist”, he said, I knew at least it was not for nature, I just wished it to be this moment we are spending together but I chose not to ask, whatever it was I full heartedly wanted to live this moment. It was all sudden that he lift me up, the feeling was delightful, me wrapping him around his neck, I so smiled at him being shy because of such sudden grace of him. He laughed and moved in melody of the moment, we were both captivated between each other eyes, he face seemed glowing, he softly place me into bed but my arms chose not to let go of his neck. I could feel the space between us getting warmer. He got over me and I was not willing to move and I couldn’t, it was so hard to face him, I got shy at that moment as he starred at me with big soft glary eyes, I slowly felt my breath start to be heavy as he slowly move toward me. He had my forehead kissed and went for cheeks for long. I felt breathless, then I got calm and find it soothing when he got my lips, as I started to feel like moving my lips onto him, he ended it with a swift sound, I get that he meant a simple one. He looked at me and started to laugh, “You love it don’t you”, he said, I could feel my face become so red, I said I didn’t and shy away my sight, he kept laughing and slept beside me, held my head and back, pulled me to his chest, my arms got stuck. I felt it funny, he let me have my arms around his neck, He wrapped me, I felt so at ease. “I felt happy that you kept me up always, you never left, seeing you I always have it in mind” he said. I felt a sudden burst of thorns, the moments of past, not able to carry on, but it was him, how can I even think of any second thought about him. It was him and I wholeheartedly knew it, the one I chose to be with. I felt right at the present, that I have him and me in his arms and me in his arms, I just moved my head towards his neck.” I wish to see you happy, I never want you to go through that anymore” he said, I faced him, kept my hands at his face, “I was happy, because it was you, yes I felt awful words for you because how much I tried to express that what you mean to me and how much I really want to be with you, there was always I felt, that I can’t get really close to you at all” I sadly said remembering all those days I have been through. His eyes was all into me, but all of a sudden his sight got down, his face showed a sight of a cold, unpleasant winter. I felt that those weren’t appropriate words to say at that moment. “But you chose me right, of anyone else” I said it, holding his chin to have a look at me, “ I want to make you feel the happiest of all” were my words with ecstatic smile. It was at that moment where I could barely see anything but his moist eyes. I could feel my heart beating harder then ever as he came close, I closed my eyes and he started to have my moist lips, I felt his warm hands soothing my face and reaching my hairs. It was all slow as the soothing breeze of wind. I loved his lips moving in me, I was having sudden urge to breath to have myself at ease, I couldn’t feel myself relaxed, I wanted to roar, I wanted to have myself all over him but I kept having little spark inside chest as he closes his lips onto me, but there was something heavy in him I felt from him, as if he is expressing some grief, I hold his face and moved upward, I gestured my face to ask what’s the thing he is going through. “I never would make you go through again, hearing your words I totally felt you have been under such dark clouds for so long, hoping to see the sun” sadly he said, “I totally felt the insecurity you have been through, all you needed was me right?”, he added moving his head, “You chose to be with me “ I happily said, “Yes, I could live under day and have the clear sky anywhere, but I chose the night, indeed that was dark clouds, but there was always a glare, hazy, but a shine all over, despite those dark clouds, I was able to find myself pleasing in those shine, because all I was there is to have the most beautiful thing I have ever known, ever felt”, I said moving my fingers slowly feeling his face. Looking deeply into his eyes, I said “It’s the moon, you are my moon, I wanted to see my world not under the clarity of sun but with the beauty of moonlight. My world that I see is way beautiful than ever”, I looked at him so softly, he lift my head a little, held me more tight and relived himself by his tears, I was happy and fulfilled, It was first time I saw him in tears, it didn’t carried any grief, but all full of joy of having me, yet some sadness him really did followed. I started to have him more towards me, all I can think was he will never let me away from his sight, his most desirable person. I felt like I could so much depend on him. It was very funny, that I felt I want to fall for him again. I rubbed his head, I feel his face and had him sit facing me, I kept caressing his hair, seeing such a silence in him. I rested both my hand around his neck, I looked at him so deeply, his eyes got so soft, I felt like I could carrying him to the best within himself. I made him laid on his back, I was all over him. He touched my face slowly starred at my eyes and beyond, I was in is soft grasp, “Your love for me was your Innocence, but knowing me was your sheer effort” he said. Such kind words, kept ringing in me, felt like those were the words I have been wanting to hear from heart, I was fulfilled. That was a moment I felt like I was so close to him, that there should exist no space for even a thought. I felt his chest was warm, I had my palm feel his chest to neck, he closed his eye in pleasance. I had my breath deep feeling that. It was the time I couldn’t get my hands off him, I felt his warm body, the touch of him was more than just a pleasure, his chest to the tip of his palm, everything was cherished by me. I went close to his face, I had the brightest smile, he then followed, “You are beautiful”, he said, I blushed so brightly, I felt his hair and face, he was so much pleased by my touch, I kissed him all over his face, I felt him so happy. I was definitely a moment, I always longed for, the closeness of heart, that melt with each blink of stare, portraying it in word would definitely be wrong thing to do. What thought and feelings are like, we knew that moment, having each other at each others heaven, sharing the space where only our heart belongs, that was the moment when we realized, till date we were relived by each others words and presence, now sharing our body felt a thing, much greater than we even felt before, a certain sensation, where  our breath sync, we felt like one, exploring each other ourselves. I couldn’t resist, but kiss his neck, it was a soft approach by me, I was Intoxicated, that essence of contact was so intoxication, I kept caressing his face and hair, I had my tongue all over his moist neck, so gently, so softly, I felt him moved by it. Wild in me reacted, I reached my arms around his neck and had my tongue more deeply, he wrapped me so tight, so tight that I could feel him having the most pleasure, I grabbed his hair by back all of a sudden, I realized I became too much of myself. I kept going deep kissing his neck. It was such pleasure hearing him moan, He trembled the moment I had the kiss more deep, seeing him in such pleasure, he held me more tight, such a thing will exist, I was very uncertain of, maybe that was our start, the glimpse of Intimacy was all I can see, where I cannot see beyond this moment but definitely feel something and somewhere that we reached, where we came more close, we kissed so passionately, all in mind there was only getting into each other. Slowly the blue started to fill the entire room. I was drawn back to the moment I realize it’s the same moment from yesterday, I became silent as I stared at the window. He smiled, knowing that I remembered, “Last night, you carried me to such pleasure, I was more than anything that can be called just good” I said. I had my eyes got big, realizing I had my wild side, from him last night, I didnt realized I wanted to have him the same same pleasure I got. The touch, the moist, the essence and everything. “It feels different to be having the same thing from you” he said, “I want you to close your eyes” I wanted to explore him more, I held him down and started feeling his chest, It was warm. Every time I moved my hands on him, he had his breath at ease. It so soothes me inside seeing him, like that, just the morning winter sun. We both had all our emotions out in breaths, smile was all we could express each other that time. The feeling of relying on each other, I couldn’t define it, was all I could say. Resting our soul on someone had us explore such a vibrant void, we feel nothing but the real essence of ourselves. He found me so reliable, I felt such peace knowing it. He realy had me felt like. I have such a space in him, not even he could managed to move, he let me in his path, where he could only do is walk, going through just anything, where he could hold me so he never get lost in himself. I became like his mirror of thoughts. It was such pleasance. I wasn’t realy sure of it, the reflection of me he felt in him, between this words of me, where moment passed from getting ourselves from moist to the sounds, the melodies of our pleasure, intimately soothing, caressing each other to the part where we could be nothing but silence. Pain and pleasure all felt the same, we lost ourselves into each other, time felt shy passing, for the moment we had, immense was all I had as a word. We didn’t cared for the world that time, world felt like the dust through amber, only our soul existed. We had a journey, where we couldn’t measure any distance, we were carried by the wind of promises, that we had to each others, time passed like endless melodies, which we never want it to end. Moments was all we could feel that time. Such a feeling of being in love and being loved at the same moment. “Its time”, seeing the window I said, it was all blue, marvelous, it just felt from the same glare I touched yesterday. All we did was passing our smiles, such should of gesture, then our kiss was to end the moment. We both had the same Intent, the view, the heavenly view. There was the balcony, we got up from bed, we felt fulfilled, I rushed to grab his hand and just to see it, he took the blanket, we reached to the balcony. And what?, the Cloud, the river, the wind, the forest, the mist, but not the moon, I stared at him, I was happy, he was my moon in my gloomy sky. It was funny he wrapped me with blanked first. It was a pleasant scenery, I had him wrapped my his waist, feeling cold breeze at face, yet I was so warm, we talked such, the river sang along the melodies of the blue glare, cloud was yet to release its dearest, yet it was so beautiful. Hills covered as the preacher of the wind, there was a shine was all I could say as the distance seem carrying the endless beauty of our thoughts. “What would you like to be if you got to chose?” I asked him, “Closest” he replied, I laughed my heart out, all of happiness. Out of anything, that I would expect to hear, he told me something that come up with such a word, I kissed him, he felt like a reward, he giggled. We both spend such scenery that we belong there, the vital part of that natural beauty. The Jewel is then revealed, I just saw straight to his face after seeing the first glance of the moon. He was captivated, he loves it, I always knew. Such moment it was, indescribable. I rested my head on him yet he didn’t reacted, I realized he was too much into himself, a pure essence of his nature, I kept seeing the moon but had the thought about his insight, I was such free at the moment I wanted to fly across and above the twinkling river and the forest and across the hill, I was secured that I wouldn’t be lost in the thought, all because of him. And the time came the jewel was all out, “How you feel?” I asked, “With you now, I want nothing else seeing it” he replied with such a smile, I got so much drawn to myself, searching for the cause, peace was all I found. The last kiss, was what happened, it was so passionate, such a beautiful feeling it carried though. Having with him with the wonders. “Aren’t we Dissolved?”, I asked, implying the lost in moment. “I am more dissolved in you dear” he said. It was soothing, looking at his eyes, I feel outmost valued by such words. “Carry me” I said, he understood what I meant, He blushed as there was no end to his happiness. By lifting me up, we had no words to say, as we happily parted with the warm essence of cold winter and the kingdom of the night sky. It was again the warmth of the bed we dwelled so closely, melted by touch and pulled by our words, we had the same pleasing moment , but he got me this time and I was no different that him, that deep breathing, the moan, my soul roared, dwelled in the glance of the moment between up, every breath of me spoken, cherished his very presence, my moan were all the verses of our love song. We so much belong to each other was floating in both our faces. I wanted to let go of this world, It had been all good for us till now. He switched off the ambers and now we were ready to let go, I rested on his shoulder keeping my hands on his chest, his arms wrapped me as a blanked, “What would you be if we weren’t together?”, he asked, I touched his face, starred at his eyes for a moment, I smiled and said “I might love you till death and might never have any words with you ever again, I was never afraid dear, Love was never too shallow, not at least to me”, I replied with such a bright voice, but from inside I realy felt off. “You always told me I am such a valuable person, that’s why you admire me, I deny it all, I never believed in these words. Its you who are most precious, the way you love me, no one in this world would, you are the only reason you love this way, your selfless efforts of doing just anything without thinking for yourself, all because of the person your are. You are so much into me, ever and all, you are only reason, I was just a person, you made me a soul.” He said. Tears started expressing their love for my gloomy eyes, found their way out of it. “It was my bad asking you that, the words you replied pierced me deep” he said kissing my forehead, “I fully trust your words, I know what you have been through, living all by yourself. I have been in Love before, I have already known what Love was, but after you came in to me, I realized I never knew what it realy means to be in Love and being Loved” he said softly caressing me, “I was closed, you showed be what love can realy be, you opened me up, ironically you welcomed me into you” were his words. “I will always be open for you to step in me, until I step off the edge, falling grace never would come out alive dear. I was glad you save me the fall from that edge” I said. “If I didn’t, I would have known what it means to be felt lost and never found” he said. I didn’t carried much into our words. I was filled, except for the kiss. It was the last for that moment and this was all to say how we depended on each other. I gazed deep into him, laid all my breath out. He had me rested on him and never would let me go any moment soon that all I felt. That’s how we implied ourselves to the silence. Nothing but moment was the only witness for us, as nothing else could bear the burden of such deep words. It was for pure Intent that we came so close, but grief was never to far from such intent. Its not always that people carry on with tiniest hope as light on walking such grave path so dark. Its not because of the little light of hope that they can see the way through the graveyard of thoughts, but having a sun inside them, not realizing the way they walked make those graves became the most living of all. The path didn’t seemed dark at all. Through my journey, I was glad he knew that I was more than just a person. At the end I realized, dead flower carries something more than just its essence."
